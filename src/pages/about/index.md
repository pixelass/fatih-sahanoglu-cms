Fatih was born on April 30th 1986 in Munich, Germany. Son of a family that has been living in Germany for 3 generations. In his two year career as an actor, one of the make-up artists noticed his flair and sense for art. It didnâ€™t take too long that he chose to try something new. In 2002 he finally started his apprenticeship as a hairdresser, which he finished in 2005. He always knew that this was only the beginning. He never wanted to accept the existence as a hairdresser.

Life has so much more to give than just the mainstream, you can see on the streets today. After two years as a journeyman he finally made his master in 2007 in the Oberpfalz in Bavaria. After one year of apprenticeship he started giving cutting seminars. In the same time he spent a lot of time with photography.

In 2008 he met the photographer, Bert. Fatih and Bert are inflamed. With huge lust for photography and retreated to absolute isolation. Bert supplemented Fatih, as he did Bert.

In January 2010 the time had come. After two years of building time, his own inspiration and manual work, his artwork was finally opened to all his friends with a big welcome.
