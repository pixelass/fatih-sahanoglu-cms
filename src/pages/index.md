  description: >
    Standard... I can't live with that.
    I live my individual lifestyle. and rather listen to my friends and customers, than wear expensive clothing and play big or talk as if I was.
    I try to find the perfect match with a well planned, direct, unforced chat and empathy. Lean back and enjoy. Together we have enough time to find what fits you best. Dive into the underground and forget everything around you.
